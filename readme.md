# Akan Name Generator

This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and gender and calculates their **Akan Name**. In Ghana, children are often named based on the day of the week they were born.

##  Description
This project was built to practice fundamental web development skills, including handling user input, performing mathematical calculations in JavaScript, and styling a functional UI with CSS. It uses the first two digits of the year (century), the last two digits of the year, the month, and the day to calculate the exact day of the week using Zeller’s Congruence.

##  Features
* **Date Calculation:** Accurately determines the day of the week for any birthdate.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures users select a gender and provide a valid date before processing.
* **Responsive UI:** A clean, mobile-friendly interface for an easy user experience.
* **Akan Culture:** Educates users on traditional Ghanaian naming conventions.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the structure and input forms.
* **CSS3:** For custom styling and layout.
* **JavaScript:** For the logic, form validation, and name mapping.
